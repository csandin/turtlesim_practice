# turtlesim_practice
A turtlesim package for ROS Kinetic. Includes several different control scripts (some good, some bad).

Scripts turtlesim_control.py and turtlesim_control2.py can be run individually.

A launchfile creating a turtlesim_node instance, then calling turtle_guide.py, then turtle_follower.py is reccomended for fast startup. If you opt for no launchfile, then start the nodes in that order.
